[x] Working finite difference discretization of Poisson's problem (15 pts.)
    - Looks okay, but cannot be tested because the code is not working. (-3 pts.)
[x] Working implementation of at least one solver (15 pts.)
    - Looks okay, but cannot be tested because the code is not working. (-3 pts.)
[ ] Code works correctly when using multiple MPI ranks (20 pts.)
    - Cannot be tested 
[ ] In addition to being correct, the code never stores full copies of matrices, vectors, etc. on any single process (10 pts.)
    - Rank #0 does keep full copies.
[ ] Diagram describing the partition of the grid (10 pts.)
[ ] Description of the algorithm in pseudo-code (10 pts.)
[ ] Description of debugging strategies (optional)
[ ] Testing of the code (20 pts.)
[ ] Scalability (bonus, 5 pts.)
