Points: 77/100

General remarks:
- Please make sure that you understand the difference between a Jacobi iteration and a Jacobian.
  One is an iterative solver, the other is the derivative of a function in multiple variables.

[x] Correct finite difference discretization of Poisson's problem (5 pts.)
[x] Correct algorithm for Jacobi solver (5 pts.)
[x] Working OpenCL implementation (20 pts.)
[ ] Verification of OpenCL code based on errors (10 pts.)
    - Verification is missing. Please report errors and compare to other codes. (-15 pts.)
    - Note that your code does not compute the true error, since you do not read the solution back to host memory after calling the solver.
[ ] Comparison of errors to serial code (10 pts.)
[ ] Comparison of errors to GPU code (10 pts.)
[x] Runtimes for OpenCL code (10 pts.)
    - You measure the times for *one* iteration, i.e., you should not divide by the number of iterations again.
      This is the reason why the time per iteration decreases when you increase the problem size.
[x] Runtimes for CPU code (10 pts.)
[x] Runtimes for GPU code (10 pts.)
    - The reduced number of iterations with increasing problem size clearly indicates a problem.
      The CUDA code from the website does not exhibit this behavior.
      In any case, please do not leave such an extreme difference in the results uncommented. (-5 pts.)
[x] Discussion of results (10 pts.)
    - Please compare the results obtained on the GPU with CUDA and OpenCL. (-3 pts.)
