8/20 points: code compiles and runs
- code does not run past one iteration.

11/15 points: good code practices
- using (N+2)x(N+2) threads instead of NxN threads.
 
15/15 points: discussion of parallelization strategy 

10/15 points: discussion of code verification
- Iteration count mentioned but not reported.  Error comparison?

15/30 points: provide throughput and bandwidth, roofline and computational discussion
- FLOP counts likely highly inaccurate since code does not run
