== Code and documentation ==

- When you allocate memory, please also deallocate it with free().
  It's not necessary in main(), but good practice.
- What you call "error" in the code is the residual. It is correct to stop the
  iteration based on the residual, but the problem also asked for the error
  compared to the exact solution.
  (-5 pts.)
- Note that clock() measures CPU time, not elapsed real time, and that
  CLOCKS_PER_SEC is not actually the number of clock cycles per second.


== Verification and operation counts ==

- Verification of the code for N=2 is missing.
  (-10 pts.)
- Please explain the operation count.
  (-2 pts.)


== Documentation of number of iterations, timings, and scaling results ==

- Documentation of errors for N=10,20,30 is missing.
  (-5 pts.)
- Please discuss the memory consumption on a theoretical level to get a feeling
  for its behavior (O(N), O(N^2), etc.).
  (-2 pts.)
